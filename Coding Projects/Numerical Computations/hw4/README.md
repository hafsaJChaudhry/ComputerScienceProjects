How many ways can you lay out a deck of cards in a line?
52 cards in a deck, all permutations is 52!.
Thus, just compute 52 factorial.

How many five card hands from a deck of 52 cards?
This is an n choose m problem. n! / ((n-m)! m!).
n is 52, m is 5. Direct computation, no math reductions.

print all digits as an integer, big number,
no scientific notation E+xx.
