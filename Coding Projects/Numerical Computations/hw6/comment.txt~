System Information: 
I ran this code in C, with my Windows 10 Laptop Computer

Comments:
The normalized time started off at right above 10 seconds for the 100 x 100
But for 200x200, 400x400, and 800x800 it dropped down to around 7 seconds each.
For 1600x1600 and 3200x3200 is increased drastically to about 15 and 20 seconds respectively.
