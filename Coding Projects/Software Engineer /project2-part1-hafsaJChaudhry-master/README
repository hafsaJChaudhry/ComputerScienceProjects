Part 1: Tic-Tac-Toe (40% of Project 2 Grade)
kernel module used to play against user in tic-tac-toe

implementations:
1)virtual character device (with a corresponding entry in /dev that the user can open a file descriptor to)
2)interact with the user using normal file read and write operations

Module will work by: 
1)user opens a file descriptor to the module's /dev entry (which shall be named /dev/tictactoe)
2)writes commands to that file descriptor with the write() system call
3)reads the responses to those commands with the read() system call

Module must keep track of:
1)state of the game board
2)implement logic to read and parse commands
3)check the validity of any commands
4)check if the game is over (win or draw?)

Module named tictactoe.ko once it is compiled.
added 4.Exit to exit driver

**TO SET READ AND WRITE PERMISSION**
sudo chmod 666 /dev/tictactoe_dev

cc tictactoe_game.c -o tictactoe
