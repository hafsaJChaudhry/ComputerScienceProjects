Each error should be reported only once.  For example, testCSRExact()
must test the correctness of the arrays after each edge is added to
the graphs. Suppose m_nz is incorrect after each edge is added.  The
"Incorrect m_nz" error should only be added to the Error queue one
time.

In all the errors described below, the first column is the point
deduction, the second column is the error id number, and the third
column is the error description.

testCSRExact()

  Test exact correctness of m_re, m_nz, and m_ci.  Assume m_re
  initialized to all zeroes.  Should test the arrays after each edge
  is added to the graphs.
  
  Three independent errors; total deduction of up to 15 points
  
   5  101  Incorrect values in m_re
   5  102  Incorrect values in m_nz
   5  103  Incorrect values in m_ci
   0  100  No errors in testCSRExact()

testCSRUnordered()

  Test correctness of m_re, m_nz, and m_ci ignoring whether the data
  for each row is ordered by increasing m_ci values.  Should test the
  arrays after each edge is added to the graphs.
  
  Only one of two errors can occur; total deduction up to 10 points
  
  10  201  Incorrect m_re; cannot perform unordered test
  10  202  Failure of undordered test of CSR
   0  200  No errors in testCSRUnordered()

testNbIterator()

  Test the NbIterator for each vertex in the graph.  
  
  Two independent errors; total deduction up to 10 points.
  
   5  301  Incorrect neighbor set size
   5  302  Incorrect values from neighbor iterator
   0  300  No errors in testNbIterator()

testEgIterator()

  Two independent errors; total deduction up to 10 points.

   5  401  Incorrect edge set size
   5  402  Incorrect values from edge iterator
   0  400  No errors in testEgIterator()

testExceptions()

  For each operation which should throw an out_of_range exception,
  either it throws the out_of_range exception (no deduction), throws
  some other exception (2 point deduction), or throws no exception at
  all (5 point deduction).

  Total deduction up to 30 points.
  
   5  511  Constructor with n = 0 did not throw an exception
   2  512  Constructor with n = 0 threw incorrect exception
   0  510  No errors in testExceptions(), construtor with n = 0
   
   5  521  Constructor with n < 0 did not throw an exception
   2  522  Constructor with n < 0 threw incorrect exception
   0  520  No errors in testExceptions(), construtor with n < 0

   5  531  addEdge() with bad destination vertex did not throw an exception
   2  532  addEdge() with bad destination vertex threw incorrect exception
   0  530  No errors in testExceptions(), addEdge() with bad destination vertex

   5  541  addEdge() with bad source vertex did not throw an exception
   2  542  addEdge() with bad source vertex threw incorrect exception
   0  540  No errors in testExceptions(), addEdge() with bad source vertex
   
   5  551  Dereference of neighbor end iterator threw no exception
   2  552  Dereference of neighbor end iterator threw incorrect exception
   0  550  No errors in testExceptions(), dereference of neighbor end iterator
   
   5  561  Dereference of edge end iterator threw no exception
   2  562  Dereference of edge end iterator threw incorrect exception
   0  560  No errors in testExceptions(), dereference of edge end iterator
