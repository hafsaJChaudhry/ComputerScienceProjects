# Coding-Projects
All my coding projects that I still have access to 

These are from my undergraduate years when I was completing my compsci degree in the school of engineering

At the time, I was new to comp sci and switched from biology. So I had no understanding of how to code at all. I also did not know how github worked and would save all my files on my SSH bash terminal or on my laptop. I broke my laptop ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜“ and lost most of my old projects, or could only retrieve certain copies etc....ðŸ˜¥ ðŸ˜© 

This is a list of what I COULD retrieve
